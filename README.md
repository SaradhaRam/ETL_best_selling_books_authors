# ETL Project - Amazon Best selling books

Team members - Cy Miller, Francis Duffy, Gorkem Varol, Mohamed Ismael, and Saradha Ramasamy
Project Title - Amazon Best selling books

Project Proposal:

We will be using data of top book sales on Amazon from kaggle.com as well as from Amazon itself, and also The New York Times bestsellers from dataworld.com. We will use pgadmin to create the tables, load the data, and transform the data. Web scraping to get data, and pandas for cleaning. 
We will clean, join, aggregate, and filter the data. The final production database will be relational, and use tables of genre, author, year, etc.
